Hi there! 

So you finally checked out my crappy code?

I wrote this as a way of implementing some of
the basic concepts i've learnt in JavaScript so far.
I'm versioning this one 1.0 because i plan to add a
countdown timer, a carlendar, and maybe a reminder to it eventually.

Any suggestions to improve this code are welcome.
Cheers.
